                <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has
                    originated and found habitability. While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the
                    Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet with its
                    ocean, making it an ocean world. The polar regions currently retain most of all other water with
                    large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and
                    atmospheric water. The other 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and
                    islands, and is widely covered by vegetation. Below the planet's surface lies the crust, consisting
                    of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
                    earthquakes. Inside the Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere,
                    deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>
